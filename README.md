## Welcome to the United States Geological Survey. 
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use 
change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The USGS is interested 
in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. 


## Visualization: Import & Visualize the Data

*  Using earthquake data set to create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
*  Data markers will be popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
